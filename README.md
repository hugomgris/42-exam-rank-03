Exercises for Exam rank 03 at 42 school

There are only two subjects in this exam, you are either asked to replicate printf with indexes %sdx or to build a get_next_line function. 

I wanted to have a one-file approach to both of them, as well as make them comply as much as possible with Norminette (I'm fancy like that). 

ft_printf here accomplishes that, it's a one-file build that passes all checks and has been tested with grademe42. 

get_next_line here has, to the extent of my abilities, an unavoidable "problem" regarding Norminette because you either break it into a couple of files or you just accept being flagged for having too many functions in a single file. I chose the second option, because submitting a single file seems more fun. This build has also been tested with grademe42.

If you find any bug, have any optimization tips or just want to reach out for whatever reason, don't hesitate to contact me.

Hope this helps you during your exam prep <3
